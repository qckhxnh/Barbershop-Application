#Barbershop Database Management Application.
This is a barbershop database management application, done as the final project for the Basic of Database course at LUT University.

Using this application, customers can list the barbers and services that the barbershop provide, as well as book, update and cancel appointments.

Because of the project time limit, the features this application provides are simple, and there are still flaws (i.e: Customers can still book Barbers who are not available at specific hours)
